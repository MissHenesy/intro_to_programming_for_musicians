    <h1>Henesy Assignment 6, Part 1</h1>
    <p>This is unplanned. It really just happens. Let's put some highlights on these little <a href="https://learn.corel.com/tutorials/painting-happy-evergreen-trees/" target="_blank">trees</a>. The sun wouldn't forget them. Here we're limited by the time we have. Take your time. Speed will come later. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. A fan brush can be your best friend. Zip. That easy.</p>

      <li>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.</li>
      <li>Every time you practice, you learn more.</li>
      <li>In your world you can create anything you desire:
    <ol>
      <li>Happy little clouds</li>
      <li>Happy little trees</li>
      <li>A little happy sunlight</li>
      <li>Happy little accidents</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.</li>
    <li>Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</li>

        <td valign="top" width="30%">We can fix anything. This is a fantastic little painting. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. You can do it. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Imagination is the key to painting. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</td>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Just a little indication. This painting comes right out of your heart. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</td>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">A beautiful little sunset. Be brave. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. See there how easy that is. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.</td>

    <p><em>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</em></p>
